## About the Project  
This project blends **storytelling with data visualization in Python** to imagine a day with an AI companion named **Yumi**.  

- **Yumi** (由美) means *“reason and beauty”* in Japanese.  
- She’s more than just an algorithm — she’s envisioned as a warm, empathetic digital presence.  
- The project demonstrates how AI can make everyday life **calmer, smarter, and more human**.  

The article-style notebook includes both **narrative writing** and **Python-generated visualizations** for:  
- Sleep tracking  
- Workload organization  
- News summarization  
- Stress monitoring
